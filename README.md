# Data_Science_Projects
Data scientists spend 80% of their time convert data into a usable form - Here I have some example of them in different domain science areas: Volcanology, Seismology and Social Computing. 


Furthermore, I have prepared a presentation (DataScience_Areas.pdf) that explains to a high level, which are the areas / technologies/ skills that are needed from Data Science depending on what you want and how you want to analyze a dataset
